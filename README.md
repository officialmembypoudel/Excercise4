1. Create a base class called "Shape" with a virtual method called "CalculateArea"
that returns 0.
2. Create a derived class called "Circle" that inherits from "Shape" and overrides the
"CalculateArea" method to calculate and return the area of a circle using the
formula: pi * radius^2.
3. Create an instance of the "Circle" class with a radius of 5. Call the "CalculateArea"
method and print out the result.
